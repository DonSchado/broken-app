# Facebook Lite

**This example App seems to be broken! Go ahead and fix it!**

Someone srewed up, but luckily we have a couple of high level feature specs.
Most of the issues are very common to happen expecially new developers,
so maybe (s)he just didn't know what (s)he was doing.

Maybe you can also fix the bootstrap layout?
For some reason it doesn't work...

For the functional part,
checkout the feature spec and remove each next `skip` after a green scenario.

*red* - *green* - *red* - *green* - ...

### More Homework

- Implement the possibility that a logged in user can edit his "profile".
- Implement something like a *follow this user* action, to associate followers
- Show the followers count on the users#show view
- Scope the posts on the welcome#index view to only show the posts from followers
